# Books Chalange

This project is a proposed challenge that use the Google book api and allow the user to see the details of each book clicked and load more books.

In order to achieve the proposed objectives, both as functionality and quality of code, we use:

## Main dependences

- React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router DOM: a JavaScript lib that allows to create "Declarative Routes" in the client-side
- Material Ui: React components lib
- Axios: Pormise base HTTP client for a browser and node.js
- Google Books API: The Books API is a way to search and access that content, as well as to create and view personalization around that content.

## Development dependences

- Eslint and theirs plugins: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Maintain your code quality with ease.
- Prettier: An opinionated code formatter
